# Tab Key Simulation Script

This repository contains a Python script designed to simulate periodic **Tab key presses** when the cursor remains inactive for a specified duration. It provides a practical solution for scenarios requiring automated activity simulation, making it highly useful in specific use cases.

## Features

- Simulates Tab key presses every 10 seconds of cursor inactivity.
- Detects cursor movement to pause simulated activity.

## Download

The `.exe` version of the script is available for download:

- [Download Tab Key Simulator (Windows)](https://github.com/md-naciri/TabKey/releases/latest/download/tab_key.exe)

### Running the Executable
